# Hi, I'm Ingrid! 👩🏻‍🦰

I am currently studying front-end development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, with graduation set for summer 2025. I am deeply passionate about creating accessible, visually pleasing web pages with engaging interfaces and functionalities. My enthusiasm extends to web design and user experience, where I am always eager to learn and expand my skillset in the broader spectrum of web development.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a great passion for music, and I actively pursue climbing and outdoor activities. These hobbies greatly influence my creative process, fueling my work in design and other creative fields.
